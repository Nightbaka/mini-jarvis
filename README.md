# Bingchat voice integration - AI assistant
This project is leveraging [Silero](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models)'s TTS and STT models and [acheong08](https://github.com/acheong08/EdgeGPT)'s bing chat integration library to create AI voice assistant. Project is now working, but still needs a lot of improvement and bugfixes.
